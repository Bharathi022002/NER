(obama saw his father only one\\nmore time, during a brief visit when obama was 10.) later ann remarried, this time to another foreign\\nstudent, lolo soetoro from indonesia, with whom she had a second child, maya. obama lived for several\\nyears in jakarta with his half sister, mother, and stepfather. while there, obama attended both a\\ngovernment-run school where he received some instruction in islam and a catholic private school where\\nhe took part in christian schooling.\\nhe returned to hawaii in 1971 and lived in a modest apartment, sometimes with his grandparents\\nand sometimes with his mother (she remained for a time in indonesia, returned to hawaii, and then went\\nabroad again—partly to pursue work on a ph.d.—before divorcing soetoro in 1980). for a brief period\\nhis mother was aided by government food stamps, but the family mostly lived a middle-class existence. in\\n1979 obama graduated from punahou school, an elite college preparatory academy in honolulu.\\nobama attended occidental college in suburban los angeles for two years and then transferred\\nto columbia university in new york city, where in 1983 he received a bachelor’s degree in political\\nscience. influenced by professors who pushed him to take his studies more seriously, obama experienced\\ngreat intellectual growth during college and for a couple of years thereafter. he led a rather ascetic life\\nand read works of literature and philosophy by william shakespeare, friedrich nietzsche, toni morrison,\\nand others. after serving for a couple of years as a writer and editor for business international corp., a\\nresearch, publishing, and consulting firm in manhattan, he took a position in 1985 as a community\\norganizer on chicago’s largely impoverished far south side. he returned to school three years later and\\ngraduated magna cum laude in 1991 from harvard university’s law school, where he was the first african\\namerican to serve as president of the harvard law review. while a summer associate in 1989 at the\\nchicago law firm of sidley austin, obama had met chicago native michelle robinson, a young lawyer at\\nthe firm. the two married in 1992.\\nafter receiving his law degree, obama moved to chicago and became active in the\\ndemocratic party. he organized project vote, a drive that registered tens of thousands of african\\namericans on voting rolls and that is credited with helping democrat bill clinton win illinois and capture\\nthe presidency in 1992. the effort also helped make carol moseley braun, an illinois state legislator, the\\nfirst african american woman elected to the u.s. senate. during this period, obama wrote his first book\\nand saw it published. the memoir, dreams from my father (1995), is the story of obama’s search for his\\nbiracial identity by tracing the lives of his now-deceased father and his extended family in kenya. obama\\nlectured on constitutional law at the university of chicago and worked as an attorney on civil rights\\nissues.\\nin 1996 he was elected to the illinois senate, where, most notably, he helped pass legislation that\\ntightened campaign finance regulations, expanded health care to poor families, and reformed criminal\\njustice and welfare laws. in 2004 he was elected to the u.s. senate, defeating republican alan keyes in\\nthe first u.s. senate race in which the two leading candidates were african americans. while\\ncampaigning for the u.s. senate, obama gained national recognition by delivering the keynote address at\\nthe democratic national convention in july 2004. the speech wove a personal narrative of obama’s\\nbiography with the theme that all americans are connected in ways that transcend political, cultural, and\\ngeographical differences. the address lifted obama’s once obscure memoir onto best-seller lists, and,\\nafter taking office the following year, obama quickly became a major figure in his party. a trip to visit his\\nfather’s home in kenya in august 2006 gained international media attention, and obama’s star continued\\nascending. his second book, the audacity of hope (2006), a mainstream polemic on his vision for the\\nunited states, was published weeks later, instantly becoming a major best seller. in february 2007 he\\nannounced at the old state capitol in springfield, illinois, where abraham lincoln had served as a state\\nlegislator, that he would seek the democratic party’s presidential nomination in 2008. (for coverage of\\nthe 2008 election, see united states presidential election of 2008.)\\nobama’s personal charisma, stirring oratory, and his campaign promise to bring change to the\\nestablished political system resonated with many democrats, especially young and minority voters. on\\njanuary 3, 2008, obama won a surprise victory in the first major nominating contest, the iowa caucus,\\nover sen. hillary clinton, who was the overwhelming favourite to win the nomination. five days later,\\nhowever, obama finished second to clinton in the new hampshire primary, and a bruising—and\\nsometimes bitter—primary race ensued. obama won more than a dozen states—including illinois, his\\nhome state, and missouri, a traditional political bellwether—on super tuesday, february 5. no clear\\nfront-runner for the nomination emerged, however, as clinton won many states with large populations,\\nsuch as california and new york. obama produced an impressive string of victories later in the month,\\nhandily winning the 11 primaries and caucuses that immediately followed super tuesday, which gave him\\na significant lead in pledged delegates. his momentum slowed in early march when clinton won\\nsignificant victories in ohio and texas. though still maintaining his edge in delegates, obama lost the\\nkey pennsylvania primary on april 22. two weeks later he lost a close contest in indiana but won the\\nnorth carolina primary by a large margin, widening his delegate lead over clinton. she initially had a big\\nlead in so-called superdelegates (democratic party officials allocated votes at the convention that were\\nunaffiliated with state primary results), but, with obama winning more states and actual delegates, many\\npeeled away from her and went to obama. on june 3, following the final primaries in montana and south\\ndakota, the number of delegates pledged to obama surpassed the total necessary to claim the democratic\\nnomination.\\non august 27 obama became the first african american to be nominated for the presidency by\\neither major party and went on to challenge republican sen. john mccain for the country’s highest\\noffice. mccain criticized obama, still a first-term senator, as being too inexperienced for the job. to\\ncounter, obama selected joe biden, a veteran senator from delaware who had a long resume of foreign\\npolicy expertise, to be his vice presidential running mate. obama and mccain waged a fierce and\\nexpensive contest. obama, still bolstered by a fever of popular support, eschewed federal financing of his\\ncampaign and raised hundreds of millions of dollars, much of it coming in small donations and over the\\ninternet from a record number of donors. obama’s fund-raising advantage helped him buy massive\\namounts of television advertising and organize deep grassroots organizations in key battleground states\\nand in states that had voted republican in previous presidential cycles.\\nthe two candidates offered a stark ideological choice for voters. obama called for a swift\\nwithdrawal of most combat forces from iraq and a restructuring of tax policy that would bring more relief\\nto lower- and middle-class voters, while mccain said the united states must wait for full victory in iraq\\nand charged that obama’s rhetoric was long on eloquence but short on substance. just weeks before\\nelection day, obama’s campaign seized on the economic meltdown that had resulted from the catastrophic\\nfailure of u.s. banks and financial institutions in september, calling it a result of the republican\\nfree-market-driven policies of the eight-year administration of george w. bush.\\nobama won the election, capturing nearly 53 percent of the popular vote and 365 electoral votes.\\nnot only did he hold all the states that john kerry had won in the 2004 election, but he also captured a\\nnumber of states (e.g., colorado, florida, nevada, ohio, and virginia) that the republicans had carried in\\nthe previous two presidential elections. on election night tens of thousands gathered in chicago’s grant\\npark to see obama claim victory. shortly after his win, obama resigned from the senate. on january 20,\\n2009, hundreds of thousands turned out in washington, d.c., to witness obama taking the oath of office\\nas president.\\n'"
